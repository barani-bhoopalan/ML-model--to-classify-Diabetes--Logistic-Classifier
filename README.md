# ML-model--to-classify-Diabetes--Logistic-Classifier
This is a complete Machine Learning project using Logistic Classifier to predict Diabetes.
Dataset Overview
The data for this lab are derived from the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which was published by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset contains information about women who are members of the Pima people -- a group of Native Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona. The dataset contains several diagnostic measurements for each woman, including whether each woman has diabetes.

Dataset Variables
The dataset contains the following variables:

Pregnancies: The number of times a woman has been pregnant

Plasma_Glucose: A measurement of a woman's plasma glucose concentration

Diastolic_Blood_Pressure: A woman's diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg)

Triceps_Thickness: The thickness of a woman's triceps skin fold (in mm)

Serum_Insulin: A woman's serum insulin level ( in mu U/ml)

BMI: A woman's body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

Diabetes_Pedigree: The likelihood of a woman having diabetes based on her family history

Age: A woman's age (in years)

Has_Diabetes: Whether a woman has diabetes (0 = does not have diabetes, 1 = has diabetes)
